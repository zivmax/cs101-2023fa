# Course Overview: Mathematical Modeling of Computational Problems

This course introduces the mathematical modeling of computational problems. 

It covers the fundamental data structures and algorithms used to solve these problems, as well as the techniques for performance measurement and analysis. 

The main topics include:

- **Basic Algorithm Design and Analysis**: Performance metrics, asymptotic notation.

- **Fundamental Data Structures**: Linked lists, stacks, queues.

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Merge sort, heap sort, quicksort.

- **Hashing**: Hash functions and hash tables.

- **Trees**: Binary search trees, balanced trees, disjoint sets.

- **Graph Algorithms**: Breadth-first search, depth-first search, topological sort, minimum spanning tree, shortest path algorithms.

- **Advanced Algorithm Design Techniques**: Divide and conquer, dynamic programming, NP problems.
