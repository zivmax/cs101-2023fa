\titledquestion{Minimum Cost Refueling}

You are planning to from city A to city B on a highway.
The distance between A and B is $d$ kilometers.
The vehicle departs with $f_0$ units of fuel.
Each unit of fuel makes the vehicle travel one kilometer.

There are $n$ gas stations along the way.
The $i$-th station is situated $p_i$ kilometers away from city A.
Note that $0<p_1<p_2<\cdots<p_n<d$.

If the vehicle chooses to refuel at the $i$-th station, $f_i>0$ units would be added to the fuel tank whose capacity is unlimited, which costs you \$$c_i$.
    You have a budget $B$, which means that the sum of costs on refueling is at most \$$B$.

    Please design a \textbf{dynamic programming} algorithm that returns \textbf{the minimum cost of refueling} to make sure the vehicle reaches the destination if the vehicle can reach the target, or returns $\varnothing$ if your budget is not enough or the fuel is not enough to support you to reach city B.

\begin{parts}
    \part[3] Define the subproblems for $i\in[0,n],j\in[0,B]$: $OPT(i, j)=$ the maximum distance you can drive if you spend \textbf{at most} \$$j$ among the first $i$ stations. Give your Bellman equation to solve the subproblems.
        \begin{solution}
            $$
                OPT(i, j) = \maxi{OPT(i-1, j)}{p_{i} + OPT(i-1, j-c_{i}),\;\case{j \geq c_{i} \text{ and } p_{i} \leq OPT(i-1, j-c_{i}) + f_{i}}}
            $$

        \end{solution}

        \part[2] What is the answer to this question in terms of $OPT$?
        \begin{solution}
            To find the minimum cost of refueling to ensure the vehicle reaches the destination, we look for the smallest $j$ such that $OPT(n, j) \geq d$. If no such $j$ exists, we return $\varnothing$.
        \end{solution}
        \part[1] What is the runtime complexity of your algorithm? (answer in $\Theta(\cdot)$)
    \begin{solution}
        The algorithm iterates over each gas station and each possible budget amount, leading to a complexity of $\Theta(nB)$, since for each $(i, j)$ pair, we compute $OPT(i, j)$ in constant time.
    \end{solution}
